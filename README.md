# Boards

An opinionated, simple, minimalistic and extendible code generator base.

This module makes it easy to use generators, and doesn't provide a cli to do so.
This means you can embed it your own cli tool without having to call extra tools (gulp, yo, etc).

## Features

* Register boards (generators)
* Register steps
* Manages stream
* Finds boards in project dependencies

## Installation

`npm i -D boards`

## Usage

[TBD]

## Todo

- Coding style fixer (instead of copying templates)
- Support config profiles (popular frameworks)
